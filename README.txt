Each person will take turns to complete the tasks. We have a Cafe and we will be working with a customer to get their order.

1) Connect index.html and external javascript page.
2) Test to make sure the page pages are connected by having "Coffee Please!" show in the console log.

3) Declare a variable named coffeeType using let syntax. Assign it to "Medium Roast".
4) Test to make sure the coffeeType shows up on the console by using console.log.

5) Declare two variables using var syntax. One of them will be latte and give it a numeric value of 2. The second one will be mocha and its numeric value will be 3.
6) Concatenate the latte and mocha variables in a console.log to show a numeric value of 5.

7) Do a boolean in another cosole.log using latte > mocha and see what happens.
8) Change the latte > mocha from number 7 to change to the opposite result in the console log.

9) Using the let syntax, create an undefined variable (one that is assigned no value) naming it sugarFree.
10) Create an alert with the variable of sugarFree.

11) Declare four let syntax variables in one line:
    1) customer1 and give a value of name as "Kamala Khan")
    2) drinkChoice with value "Chai"
    3) quantity with value 4
    4) foodAllergy with value false.
 12) Concatenate the variables in a console.log. Bonus Brag rights to make values on console.log have spaces between so separate the variable values.

 13) Create const variable called chai, with a value of 2.50, as in $2.50.
 14) Using console.log, concatenation, the multiple symbol (*),with the variables quantity and chai: see what the final price would be of the order.

 15) Try to reassign the chai  variable from a const to a let and then a var giving it a value of 2. 
 16) Give it a console.log like step 14. See what happens.

 17) Together we will decide what will happen next.

 18) After deciding what we do (step 17), we have one last thing:
 19) Create our last let variable named total. We want to assign it the following values:
    1)drinkChoice
    2) " "
    3)quantity
    4)$
    5)*
    6)chai
20) We want an alert so say "Your Final Order: " with the total variable.
