    <h1>JavaScript Basics Marathon!</h1>
    <p>A <bold>coding marathon</bold> is when we, as a whole class will write code together in front of the group one by one. In addition to this, each student will be cloning this code from GitHub and code along as well.</p>
    <p class="underline">A few things to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Everyone is required to do active participation. That means assisting the person who is in front of the group, asking questions and providing feedback. High fives and cheering is encouraged!</li>
        <li>Making mistakes is a bonus, think of it as learning to debug and fix code. </li>
        <li>Be sure to rest and stretch so you don't hurt your hands and wrists when you program.</li>
        <li>If you do not know the answer, you and your team can look it up using any resource you all have.</li>
    </ul>
